gocui has a Gui.SetManager(...Manager) that is intented to satisfy my use case.

- I should be able to create a manager function for each screen (abcd, true or false, user input,
game over, etc) and then swtich between them as needed. In the gocui examples directory, widget.go
seems to use this technique.

I am wrong. Based on what I read in the widgets.go example file, I can use the
gocui.Gui.SetManagers to set up an individual screen. The "Managers" I pass in
would be the "widgets" used in the screen.

For example, my abcd screen with have one question widget and 4 answer widgets. When
calling the gocui.Gui.SetManager, I would pass in the "parts of the screen", which are the
1 question and the 4 answers.

In order to create multiple screens, I would need to call gocui.Gui.SetManagers with
the new "parts" or components of the next screen.

Thus, it seems like each screen should get its own file.
Each Manager should probably get its own file.
The gui call backs functions should all be in one file.
(Think through the rest later)

In the above, I have figured out the issue of creating the interface, but I have not
figured out how to tie the Questions and user.Answers data structures to the
interface. That problem still needs to be solved.

Last time, I solved this problem by making everything global. In that case, every screen
has access to those variables at all times. This time, I do not want to make those variables
global. Thus, I need to figure out a way to pass the questions and user.Answers to each
screen (and each view that needs them).
