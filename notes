I just thought of a way to get rid of the global variables.

If I use linked lists as my data structure for both questions
and user answers then each node will know which node is before
and after itself.

After I finish this implementation, I will make this the next sprint.

SPRINT: USE LINK LISTS DATA STRUCTURE FOR USER ANSWERS AND QUESTIONS
